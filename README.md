# Hebrew-Teacher
iOS education application featuring Hebrew text-to-speech

Shalom, I'm trying to make the experience of Hebrew school available to anyone who has an iPad. One of the main goals of making this app was to build a library that can allow a system like iOS which doesn't have the ability to speak Hebrew do so. This app started as a project I made for my local Hebrew school as a volunteer throughout last year. Thank you to all of my Kickstarter backers and I hope you enjoy the app.

Features

1. A collection of many of the prayers that are most commonly used

2. An interactive system that will read the Hebrew words and walk you through how to say them.

3. A calendar to keep track of which days you read each prayer

4. Icons like a snowflake next to some lines to indicate that they are for example read in winter

5. A miniature compass that will help orient your body to face the proper cardinal directions when reading some prayers
